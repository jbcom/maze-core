# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Report it privately through
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/jbcom/seeded-maze/security/advisories/new), which lets
us discuss and fix the issue before it is disclosed.

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few days. If a fix is warranted, we will prepare it
privately, publish a patched release, and credit you in the advisory unless you would rather remain
anonymous.

## Supported versions

The latest `0.x` release receives security fixes. Older pre-1.0 releases are not patched unless a
coordinated disclosure requires an exceptional backport.

## In scope

Examples include package supply-chain issues, unexpected code execution during install or build,
inputs that make generation hang or exhaust memory, and vulnerabilities in the package's runtime
dependency. The seeded generator is not a cryptographic source: do not use maze seeds for anything
security sensitive.
