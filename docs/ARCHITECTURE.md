# Architecture

maze-core is a small set of pure functions over plain data. It owns no rendering, no input and no
game state: a caller hands it dimensions and a seed and gets arrays and maps back.

## Module boundaries

```text
core ──────────> seedrandom
geometry ──────> core (types only)
curves ────────> core (types), geometry, seedrandom
multiLayer ────> core, seedrandom
index ─────────> re-exports all four
```

- `core` carves a single maze and answers adjacency questions about it.
- `geometry` converts a layout into boxes, tiles and a navigation graph, and maps between grid and
  world space.
- `curves` turns the same walls into smoothed polylines and measures distances to them.
- `multiLayer` stacks mazes, joins them, and proves the result can be solved.

## Invariants

1. **A seed is the whole input.** `generateMaze` reseeds its generator on every call, so a layout
   depends only on `(width, height, seed)` and never on earlier calls. Layered mazes derive one seed per
   layer and one per connector band from the caller's seed, so adding a layer does not reshuffle the
   layers below it.
2. **Every layout is a perfect maze.** Every cell is reachable from the centre, there are no loops, and
   the four perimeter exits are always on the boundary and never in a corner.
3. **A connector band always has a stair.** The first connector between two adjacent layers is a
   two-way `stair`, so `assertSolvable` holds for any layer count.
4. **Curved walls never change topology.** Every emitted vertex is clamped to within `maxDeviation` of
   the original wall line, measured against the original line rather than a drifted intermediate, so
   smoothing and wobble cannot open a closed wall or close an open passage.
5. **Plain data out.** No class instances, no rendering types. Everything is JSON-friendly except
   `MazeGeometry.railNodes`, which is a `Map`.

## Generation

`generateMaze` uses the Growing Tree algorithm from the centre cell: it keeps a list of active cells and
repeatedly picks one, taking the newest cell with probability 0.7 (long winding corridors, as in
recursive backtracking) and a random one otherwise (more branching, as in Prim's algorithm). It carves
into a random unvisited neighbour, and retires a cell once it has none. The 0.7 bias is part of the
seed contract.

## Why the seed contract is strict

Games store seeds in saves, replays and shared challenges. A tweak that reorders random draws is
invisible in a diff and fatal to every stored seed, so changes to draw order, the bias above, connector
placement or wobble phase are treated as breaking and are released as such.

## Performance

Generation is linear in the number of cells, plus a sort for connector placement. All functions are
synchronous; for very large mazes run them in a worker.

## Intentional limits

- Square cells on a rectangular grid; no hex, triangle or irregular topologies.
- One entrance (the centre) and four exits per layer. Moving the entrance is a caller concern.
- Geometry is described, not drawn. Turning boxes and polylines into meshes belongs to the renderer.
