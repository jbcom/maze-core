# Decisions

## 2026-10-07: CommonJS ships alongside ESM

**Decision.** The package ships native ESM (`dist/esm`) and CommonJS (`dist/cjs`), each with its own
declarations, behind `import` and `require` conditions in `exports`.

**Why.** The earlier releases were ESM-only. Nothing about the code makes CommonJS wrong: it has no
top-level await, no `import.meta` and one dependency that is itself CommonJS. A public npm package is
installed by projects the maintainer never sees, and a CommonJS toolchain (older test runners, Jest
setups, plain `require` scripts) should not need a dynamic `import()` to call a pure function. The
cost is one small build script, and both formats are held to the same behaviour by the packed-consumer
check, which compares ESM and CommonJS output for the same seed.

**How.** `tsc` emits both formats from two tsconfigs with no bundler. The CommonJS files are renamed
to `.cjs` / `.d.cts` and `dist/cjs/package.json` marks the directory `commonjs`, so the same files
resolve correctly under `"type": "module"`. `arethetypeswrong` and `publint` run in `pnpm verify`.

## 2026-10-07: MIT licence, planned npmjs release as `seeded-maze`

The package is open source. The licence is MIT, the npm name is the unscoped `seeded-maze`, and the
planned first release on npmjs is 0.2.0; it has not been published. Earlier 0.1.x releases came from a private registry and are not on
npmjs. Releases after 0.2.0 are cut by release-please and published from CI by OIDC trusted
publishing with provenance.

## 2026-10-07: Rename the package to `seeded-maze`

**Decision.** Use `seeded-maze` as the unscoped npm name and repository name, keeping version 0.2.0.

**Why.** npm refused the original name as too similar to `axe-core`. The new name describes
seed-driven, deterministic maze generation, including 3D geometry, curved walls and multi-layer
solvability. No version has been published, so the rename does not change an existing npm contract.

## The seed is part of the API

A layout is a pure function of its arguments. Any change that alters what `generateMaze`,
`generateLayeredMaze` or `buildCurvedWalls` produces for an existing seed breaks every saved game,
replay and shared seed built on it, so it is a breaking change and is released as one.

## Toolchain: Node 26 and pnpm 12 to build, Node 24 as the floor to run

`engines` is `>=24` with no ceiling and `@types/node` stays on 24: a library must not reach for an API
its oldest supported consumer lacks. CI runs the full gate on Node 24 and Node 26. TypeScript is 7
(native) with `moduleResolution: bundler`; Vitest is 5.

## Tests live next to the code

The unit tests are colocated as `src/*.test.ts` and excluded from the build output; `tsconfig.json`
covers them for typechecking. `tests/` holds the checks that exercise the package as a whole.
